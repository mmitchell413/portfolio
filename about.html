                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Matt Mitchell (which I'm sure you know by now) and I live, work and play in the great city of Dallas, Texas. When I'm not tinkering away trying to make pixels look pretty, I spend my free time making music, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family. I also like to pick up heavy things and put them down repeatedly. </p>
                    <p>Some of my other interests include action-packed movies, gut-wrenching TV dramas, fast cars, mixed martial arts, hiking, and building custom computers.</p>

                    <h3>My Background</h3>
                    <p>While attending the University of Texas at Dallas, I studied under some of the top professors in the field. I gained a vast array of knowledge and experience during my time there and owe a lot to the magnificent staff and student body of the university. I graduated in December of 2014 with a degree in Arts and Technology.</p>
                    <p>As a student, I also worked full-time at the technology help desk as a support technician before moving to an internship at <a href="http://www.visualapp.com" target="_blank">Visual App</a>, a small web design company based in Richardson.</p>
                    <p>I now work full-time as a front-end developer for <a href="https://www.gmfinancial.com" target="_blank">GM Financial</a>, helping them redefine their web presence. We are trying to make the company the industry leader in user experience and satisfaction. </p>
