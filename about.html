                <p>Let that brush dance around there and play. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.</p>

                    <p>In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>

<p>This is your world. This is unplanned it really just happens. You can do it. Put it in, leave it alone.</p>

<p>Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>

                    <p>We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. There comes a nice little fluffer. Brown is such a nice color. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.</p>
