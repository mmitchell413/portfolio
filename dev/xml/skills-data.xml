    <image>img/tech-logos/html.svg</image>
    <desc>I'm not even sure what my first experience with HTML was. I was probably fiddling around with my browser in my teenage years and ran across the "View Page Source..." button. I've been writing it ever since. </desc>

    <desc>Back in the days of MySpace, you could edit your profile's color and layouts with user input CSS. I started to get really good at it, and eventually, all my friends came to me for custom profiles. I was the coolest kid in school. </desc>

  <skill id="js">
    <name>Javascript</name>
    <image>img/tech-logos/javascript.svg</image>
    <desc>I started learning Javascript soon after learning HTML and CSS. I found that I was limited to what I could do with just those basic aspects. I didn't want to just display information, I wanted to be able to do something with that information. </desc>

    <name>jQuery</name>
    <image>img/tech-logos/jquery.svg</image>
    <desc>To be honest, the only reason I started learning jQuery was for the animations. Fading in and out elements of the DOM blew my mind. It took a while to come around to the rest of the functionality it offered. </desc>

    <image>img/tech-logos/php.svg</image>
    <desc>My first experience with PHP was in my high school independent study class. I focused on web development as a subject, and began to build a fully functional bulletin board. Naturally, PHP was the easiest and most accessible language to do the project in.</desc>

    <image>img/tech-logos/less.svg</image>
    <desc>LESS is another CSS pre-processor that has a similar feature-set to SASS. Essentially, most of the nitty-gritty behind the pre-processors are identical and only vary in syntax. </desc>
