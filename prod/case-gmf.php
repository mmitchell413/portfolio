            <h1>The Challenge</h1>
            <p>The GM Financial site redesign offered a unique challenge. I was fresh out of college and
              excited to undertake my first professional project. Within a month of being hired at GM Financial,
              the two team members above me left for other job opportunities, leaving me as the most senior member
              of the team, with only a month's experience.</p>
            <p>As a greenhorn in the industry, with management and the other freshly hired developers looking for
              leadership within the team, I decided to try my hand taking charge, despite my nervousness. Under
              ordinary circumstances, the pressure of just leading the redesign of a site that gets over two million
              visitors a month would be enough, but there was another constraint to the project: time.</p>
            <p>There was a redesign of our MyAccount platform in the pipeline as well, being developed by a third-party
              vendor. Their update was set to go live in two months, and we had have our redesign ready for production
              within the same timeframe. We had two months to redesign and develop five sites, as well as do <thead>
              QA testing for each.</p>

            <h1>Timeline</h1>
            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>Our first week on the project was mainly devoted to making design and development decisions. We had
              to decide whether to keep the current, ancient codebase or start fresh. If we had more time, we
              would have elected to just scrap the current codebase. It was horribly maintained and a huge mess,
              but with just a little over a month to completely redesign five sites, starting fresh wasn't an option.
              There just wouldn't be enough time. </p>
            <p>We had to make decisions on a number of other issues, such as how deployment would
              be handled, what styles we would need to adhere to meet WCAG compliance, .</p>
            <p>Basic development began towards the end of the week. </p>
            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>The second week was a blur as we buried our heads in our keyboards to try and get a head start on
              development. Since the third part already had a style guide created for the MyAccount portal, we
              were able to utilize that for a basic framework for development. </p>
            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <h2>Week 6-8</h2>
            <p>The final stretch of time was almost entirely devoted to QA testing. Our QA team got to work
              checking the site for any errors and inconsistencies, trying to break it in any way possible.</p>
            <p>We must have closed out over a hundred defect tickets in this time, ranging from a minor style
              inconsistency to an entire login field hidden away in the site breaking. It was a whirlwind
              of work, but the feeling of satisfaction I had from finally closing the last one out was one
              I haven't experienced before.</p>
