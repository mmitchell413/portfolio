                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>My name is Matt Mitchell and I’m a front-end web developer / designer by trade, while dabbling in back-end development and graphic design. When I’m not tinkering away trying to make pixels look pretty, I spend my free time making music, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
                        <p>Some of my other interests include action-packed movies, gut-wrenching TV dramas, fast cars, rock climbing, hiking, and building custom computers.</p>

                        <h2>My Background</h2>
                        <p>While attending the University of Texas at Dallas, I studied under some of the top professors in the field. I gained a vast array of knowledge and experience during my time there and owe a lot to the magnificent staff and student body of the university. I graduated in December of 2014 with a degree in Arts and Technology.</p>
                        <p>As a student, I also worked full-time at the technology help desk as a support technician before moving to an internship at Visual App, a small web design company based in Richardson.</p>
                        <p>I now work full-time as a front-end developer for GM Financial, helping them redefine their web presence. We are trying to make the company the industry leader in user experience and satisfaction.</p>
